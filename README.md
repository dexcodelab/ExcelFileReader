# ExcelFileReader Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the ExcelFileReader project! This project is an ASP.NET Core MVC 7 application designed to demonstrate how to use the ExcelDataReader NuGet package to read Excel files. The application allows users to upload Excel files, processes the data within them, and displays the contents to the user.

## Features
### 1. Excel File Upload
The ExcelFileReader application allows users to upload Excel files through a user-friendly interface.

### 2. Excel Data Reading
The uploaded Excel files are processed using the ExcelDataReader NuGet package. This package enables the application to read and extract data from Excel spreadsheets efficiently.

### 3. Displaying Data
After processing, the application displays the contents of the Excel files to users using ASP.NET Core MVC views. Users can easily view the data in a tabular format.

## Usage

On the home page of the application, click the "Upload Excel File" button. Select an Excel file from your local machine and click the "Upload" button.

### 2. Viewing Excel Data:
Once the file is uploaded and processed, you will be redirected to a new page displaying the data extracted from the Excel file. You can scroll through the data and analyze the contents.
